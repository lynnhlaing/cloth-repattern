# cloth-repattern
**Created by:** Aliya Chambless & Lynn Hlaing

## Introduction
For this project, we will be exploring repatterning of cloth in images in order to replace preexisting fabric textures with new colors, new textures, new fabrics or even images, while preserving depth silhouette of the clothing item. The project will be split into two sections: silhouette mask generation via edge detection and texture repatterning

## Silhouette Mask Generation

### To-Do
- Find image dataset
- Edge detection to find cloth edges
- Cloth edge selection using information from edge detection
- Cloth silhouette mask generation
- Preserve depth and edge details within mask so the repattern is not flat.

## Texture Repatterning

### To-Do
- Find textures to repattern from.
- **Texture Synthesis**: Look to preserve details of textures
- **Texture Transfer**: Look to maintain depth and detail from original image in repatterned texture.
- Output retextured images.

## Results

### To-Do
- Make presentation **(12/10)**
- Do final report **(12/11)**
